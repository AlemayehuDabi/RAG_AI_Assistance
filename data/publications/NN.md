# Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data by applying mathematical transformations. Neural networks are central to modern deep learning.

## Biological Inspiration

The human brain contains billions of neurons connected by synapses. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them, and produces output signals. ANNs abstract this process using weighted connections and activation functions to simulate decision-making and learning.

## Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data (e.g., pixels in an image).
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform transformations by applying weights and activation functions.
- **Output Layer**: Produces predictions (e.g., classification probabilities).

### Common Architectures

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: Data flows in one direction from input to output.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Designed for image and spatial data.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Process sequential data such as text or time series.
- **Transformer Networks**: Rely on self-attention mechanisms, used in NLP and beyond.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Consist of generator and discriminator networks, used for image synthesis.

## Training Process

Training a neural network involves:

1. **Forward Propagation**: Data passes through the layers to produce an output.
2. **Loss Calculation**: The difference between predicted and actual outputs is measured.
3. **Backpropagation**: Gradients are computed and used to update weights.
4. **Optimization**: Algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) adjust parameters to minimize error.

## Applications

- **Computer Vision**: Object recognition, autonomous driving, medical imaging.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken words into text.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Machine translation, text generation, chatbots.
- **Generative AI**: Creating synthetic images, music, and text.
- **Healthcare**: Predicting patient outcomes, detecting anomalies in scans.

## Limitations

- **Data Requirements**: Neural networks need large, high-quality datasets.
- **Computational Costs**: Training requires powerful hardware (GPUs/TPUs).
- **Interpretability**: Models often act as "black boxes."
- **Overfitting**: Networks may memorize training data instead of generalizing.

## Future Directions

Research is focused on neuromorphic computing, quantum-enhanced neural networks, and biologically inspired architectures. Efforts are also being made to reduce energy consumption and improve model transparency.
