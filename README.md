## 📘 Overview

**RAG Assistant** is a retrieval-augmented conversational framework that bridges **large language models (LLMs)** and **external knowledge sources**.  
It integrates **Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model** with **vector-based document retrieval**, enabling factual, contextually grounded, and memory-efficient dialogue.

This system demonstrates how retrieval and reasoning can coexist to overcome LLM hallucination while maintaining efficient context management through **summarization** and **persistent history tracking**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

- **Reduce hallucination** by grounding LLM outputs in retrieved data.  
- **Preserve conversational context** using dynamic summaries.  
- **Enable reproducibility** through structured JSON logging.  
- **Demonstrate efficient token management** for long-running interactions.

## 🧩 System Architecture

The assistant follows a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** design, consisting of:

1. **Document Ingestion & Embedding:**  
   Source documents are processed into vector embeddings using transformer-based models and stored in a local ChromaDB index.

2. **Semantic Retrieval:**  
   When a query is received, the system retrieves semantically similar chunks relevant to the current question.

3. **Contextual Reasoning with Gemini LLM:**  
   Retrieved documents are combined with a structured prompt and passed to the Gemini LLM to produce a grounded response.

4. **Conversation Summarization:**  
   To maintain long-term coherence without exceeding token limits, prior exchanges are periodically summarized and condensed.

5. **Persistent Logging:**  
   Each interaction, along with its retrieved context and generated output, is recorded in a JSON file for future analysis and reproducibility.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🧠 **LLM Integration:** Utilizes Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for reasoning and generation.  
- 🔎 **Vector Search:** Employs ChromaDB for high-performance semantic retrieval.  
- 🧾 **Memory Summarization:** Keeps conversations concise while retaining meaning.  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage:** Stores all user interactions and responses for replay.  
- ⚙️ **Prompt Control:** Incorporates a system-level instruction layer for consistent response behavior.  

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

The system was tested on research-oriented and domain-specific documents to assess:

- **Answer fidelity** — ensuring responses were grounded in retrieved data.  
- **Token efficiency** — minimizing unnecessary context expansion.  
- **Continuity** — maintaining conversational coherence across sessions.  

Results indicated a significant improvement in factual grounding and token efficiency compared to a baseline RAG setup without summarization.

## 📈 Findings

| Evaluation Metric | Baseline (No Summary) | With Summarization | Outcome |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Context Retention | Moderate | High | Improved continuity |
| Token Usage | 100% | ~60% | 40% reduction |
| Factual Accuracy | Inconsistent | Consistent | Stable grounding |
| Usability | Limited | High | Persistent replay support |

## 🧭 Future Directions

This project can be extended in several promising ways:

- **Multimodal Expansion:** Integrating image, audio, or video retrieval.  
- **Distributed Retrieval:** Scaling vector search across multiple databases.  
- **Collaborative Sessions:** Enabling shared real-time RAG experiences.  
- **Fine-Tuning:** Adapting embeddings or prompt templates for domain expertise.
